```
In an unknown way, I am a traveler,
I don't know where to go,
Can't see, look away,
Shocked. ... (1)

My gray dust is covered with dust,
Don't get me wrong,
Wherever he went, the unknown, the unknown,
It feels like a great arm. ... (2)

You are mine, hope is the stick,
The clock did not go fast,
When the rod was broken, I fell down,
I couldn't find you. ... (3)

When you say, "What are you doing to me?"
I am your servant,
Bewildered, paralyzed,
Listen to your name. ... (4)

Unknown traveler, no my address,
How far is the path,
In the sky of life, you are my moon,
Add six drops. Amount. ... (5)

Everyone knows that your existence,
But you hide,
Bhakat Ganat, Satisfied.
Tears well up. ... (6)

Go as far as you can,
Playing hide and seek,
From the sea of ​​sin, the waters of the flood,
It is said that the body becomes. ... (7)

Time is running out, Lord,
The last to be born,
What action, and janme face,
I'll take another dress. ... (8)

I have always been silent,
Never did Ali,
That's why friend, you are a friend,
Delki from the mind. ... (9)

Short time, short life,
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.
Hope is not lost, yet Lord,
Bhakat Mani's friend. ... (10)
